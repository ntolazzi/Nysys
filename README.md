# Nysys
A custom computing system.

This project is implementing a custom CPU and Memory architecture from first principles (from NAND gates) and building a complete programming toolchain on top of that architecture.
This includes a custom assembler language, a custom high-level language and corresponding assembler and compiler.

This project is heavily inspired by the book "The Elements of Computing Systems" and is my implementation of their design with certain design modification.
